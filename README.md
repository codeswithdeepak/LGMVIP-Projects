Hello Everyone..!

I'm Adarsh Pandey

Well, This Blog is to share my experience as a Web Developing Intern in the Virtual Internship Program (VIP) at LetsGrowMore which is held in September 2022.

I would like to thank Aman Kesarwani Sir and the team of LetsGrowMore Community for giving me this opportunity to enhance my skills and work on such an amazing projects.

During this Web Development Internship we were having 3 levels of tasks, out of which we needed to complete at least 2 of them for the Internship completion & certification from LetsGrowMore -

Task 1 (Beginner Level Task) : We need to create a todo list using HTML, CSS , JavaScript and ReactJS. This task is to determine the basic understanding of front-end web designing with HTML, CSS , JavaScript & ReactJS skills along.

Task 2 (Beginner level Task) : We need to create a web application using create-react-app. In this, we need to make our own UI Design, we need to create a navbar and in that navigation bar we need to mention the brand name and a button name “Get Users”.

So, as soon as we click on that button, It will fetch & load all the data of the users from the given API and then display user name, photo and mail id in the form of user card grid layout.

Task 3 (Intermediate level Task) : We need to create a registration form whose data display on the same page using HTML, CSS & Javascript or ReactJS.

Task 4 (Intermediate level Task) : We need to create a calculator using HTML, CSS & Javascript or ReactJS.
